An introduction to the https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust] programming language for Java developers

Clone this repository then follow the instructions on the link:../../wiki/Lab-part-01[Wiki]

# Prerequisites

## Linux / MacOS
🦀 Install Rust with link:https://rustup.rs[Rustup]
```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
## Windows
🦀 Download and run link:https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/i686-pc-windows-gnu/rustup-init.exe[rustup-init.exe]

***

👀 Take a look in `~/.cargo/bin`. `rustc`, `cargo` and `rustup`, should have just been installed there, along with the rest of the Rust toolchain.

## IDE

Setup an IDE of your choice. We strongly recommend the link:https://intellij-rust.github.io[Rust plugin] for Intellij as that's what we'll be coding along with but recognize it's not to everyone's tastes. If you're still determined to use something else, there is a list link:https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust#ides[here] which has the usual suspects on it.
