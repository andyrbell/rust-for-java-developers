In traditional IO, work that is IO-bound dominates threads. This wouldn't be such a big deal if we could add more threads cheaply, but threads are expensive on the JVM, and most other platforms. Even if threads were cheap and infinitely scalable, we'd still be confronted with the faulty nature of networks. Things break, and they often do so in subtle, but non-exceptional ways. Traditional approaches to integration bury the faulty nature of networks behind overly simplifying abstractions. We need something better.\n\nSpring Framework 5 introduced the Spring developer to a growing world of support for reactive programming across the Spring portfolio, starting with a new Netty-based web runtime, component model and module called Spring WebFlux, and then continuing to Spring Data Kay, Spring Security 5.0, Spring Boot 2.0 and Spring Cloud Finchley.

Therefore it is difficult for the web, mobile and backend developers to settle on a payload format that is both flexible and concise to suit all the different kinds of frontends.\n\nGraphQL is a query and schema definition language for your backend services. It can be used over different transports (e. g. HTTP, Websocket) and provides frontend developers with the ability to request exactly the information they need, making it a great solution to implement the API Gateway pattern.\n\nThis workshop starts with a brief introduction to GraphQL.
